# Design and Analysis of Algorithms Projects
In this repository I publish some projects I have made in Design And Analysis of Algorithms class:
1. [IsPrime](https://github.com/japoveda10/DesignAndAnalysisOfAlgorithmsProjects/tree/master/1.%20IsPrime) <br>
   Program that determines if a number written by the user is prime.
2. [Recurrence equations iterators](https://github.com/japoveda10/DesignAndAnalysisOfAlgorithmsProjects/tree/master/2.%20RecurrenceEquationsIteratorsProject) <br>
   Project that has the implementation of 6 iterators.
3. [Activity](https://github.com/japoveda10/DesignAndAnalysisOfAlgorithmsProjects/tree/master/3.%20Activity) <br>
   Linear search with certainty and matrix traversals.
4. [Activity 3](https://github.com/japoveda10/DesignAndAnalysisOfAlgorithmsProjects/tree/master/4.%20Activity3) <br>
   Implementation of 3 sorting algorithms and 3 solutions to the minimum coin change problem.
5. [MultipleSequenceAlignmentProject](https://github.com/japoveda10/DesignAndAnalysisOfAlgorithmsProjects/tree/master/5.%20MultipleSequenceAlignmentProject) <br>
    Aligns various DNA sequences.
